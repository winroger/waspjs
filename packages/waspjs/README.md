# webwaspjs (library)

A JavaScript port of the WASP Grasshopper plugin core logic.

## Structure
- `src/`: library source (Aggregation, Part, Rule, Collider, Visualizer, utilities).
- `tests/`: Vitest unit tests.
- `dist/`: build output (generated by tsup).

## Scripts
- `npm run build` (from root or workspace): build to `dist/` (esm + cjs).
- `npm run test` (from root): run unit tests in this package.
- `npm run lint` (from root): lint source/tests.

## Usage
Import from the package entry:
```js
import { Aggregation, Part, Rule, Visualizer, generateRules } from 'webwaspjs';
```

## Notes
- Coordinate system: Three.js Z-up (Visualizer sets `camera.up` to Z).
- Mesh serialization: supports BufferGeometry via `meshToData`/`meshFromData`.
- Collision: uses `three-mesh-bvh` accelerated raycast; colliders preferred over render meshes.
